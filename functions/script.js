// exercise 1
//This function will log 1 to the console. executing the foo function does not affect the 'bar' variable which is scoped inside of the function (because it is declared with let inside the function).

//exercise 4
//This program does not print anything to the console because the function is returned before hitting the console.log action.

//exercise 5
//this program also does not print anything to the console because there is no console.log action
